> for Saudi Arabia. This MVP demo shows the complete end-to-end
> flow. I'll book a ride, show driver acceptance, and how our
> admin sees everything in real-time."

**Transition (User → Driver):**

> "So the user booked the ride. In the next tab, let me show you
> what the driver sees. They get the order in real-time..."

**Transition (Driver → Admin):**

> "While the driver accepted the order, let's see how our admin
> dashboard updated in real-time. This is key for platform
> governance..."

**Closing:**

> "That's the complete flow. User books, driver delivers, admin
> manages. All in real-time. The code is production-ready, and
> we can go live with backend in 4-6 weeks."

## 🎯 REMEMBER THIS

**Investors ask:** "Is this real?"

**You say:** "This is a frontend MVP demo showing the product
vision and business model. The demo is fully functional - all
interactions work. The backend APIs are simulated to show how
they'll work in production. We have detailed architecture
documentation and can integrate real APIs immediately after
funding. This is common for Y Combinator companies and VCs
expect to see this level of polish."
