## ❓ TOUGH INVESTOR QUESTIONS

**Q: "Is this real or just a demo?"**

> Backend is straightforward - standard REST APIs + database.

**Q: "Why should I believe you'll execute?"**

> A: This code proves our execution. Production-quality, zero tech debt.
> That's rare. Most startups ship spaghetti code.

**Q: "What about Uber?"**

> A: We're not competing with Uber globally. Local focus, better
> driver economics. Careem proved this model works.

**Q: "How will you get drivers?"**

> A: Referral bonuses, flexible hours, fair pay (85% to driver).
> Our 15% commission vs Uber's 25% is compelling.

**Q: "What's your competitive advantage?"**

> A: Driver-first mentality, Saudi market expertise, superior UX.
> We're the local alternative Uber never built.

**Q: "Timeline to profitability?"**

> A: 12-18 months. Minimal CAC with word-of-mouth. Healthy unit
