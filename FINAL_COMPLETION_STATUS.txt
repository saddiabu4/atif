## 🎓 Key Learning Points

### What We Learned
1. ✅ Framer Motion doesn't have a `button` component variant
2. ✅ Using `motion.div` with `onClick` is the correct approach

4. ✅ All HTML elements can be made interactive with proper handlers
5. ✅ Event handling and propagation is crucial
6. ✅ Localization requires careful attention to detail
7. ✅ Testing is essential for production quality

### Best Practices Applied
